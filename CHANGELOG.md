- Release discipline: `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/RELEASE.md`, `scripts/setup.sh`, pre-push hooks

- Separate `deploy.yml` for tag-based EC2 deployments

- ADRs (`docs/adr/`), threat model (`docs/security/threat-model.md`), GitHub issue templates

### Changed

- Split monolithic GitHub Actions workflow into `ci.yml` (quality gates) and `deploy.yml` (releases)
- Enriched pull request template with changelog and base-branch checks
- Updated deploy GitHub Actions to current major versions (`actions/checkout@v5`, `docker/setup-buildx-action@v4`, `docker/build-push-action@v7`) to align with Node 24 runtime
- Renamed deploy Docker image/container from `tracker-web(-test)` to `geminislabs-web` in EC2 deployment flow
- Refactored Docker build to inject `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` via BuildKit secrets instead of `ARG`/`ENV` in `Dockerfile`

### Removed

- Dead scoped CSS from `src/routes/+page.svelte` (zero `css_unused_selector` build warnings)
- Unused `.alert--demo` styles from billing payment-methods page
